## Dark and Blue Theme"

My very first theme i have created, a nice blue and purple color hope you all like it. There will be more changes in the coming weeks. it's still at it's early stages. This was all made possible by watching CoderCoder's tutorial on how to make a VS Code extension theme. Check out her youtube channel.

**Enjoy!**
