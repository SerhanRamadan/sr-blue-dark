## Dark and Blue Theme"

My very first theme i have created, hope you all like it. There will be more changes in the coming weeks. it's still at it's early stages. This was all made possible by watching CoderCoder's tutorial on how to make a VS Code extension theme. Check out her youtube channel.

**Enjoy!**
